# Basic Financial Concepts

### What is a Stock?

A stock like **APPL**, is a financial instrument representing a **fractional ownership stake in a corporation** such as Google or Costco. **A unit of stock is called a "share."** "Shares"respective values are proportional to the total monetary worth of a company. 

Note that stocks for a given company are identified by a combination of letters and symbols rather than the company name; this is called its **ticker symbol.** For example, the ticker symbol for Apple is **APPL**.

### What is a Position?
A position represents **how much of a particular stock is owned by an individual or financial firm.** Simply put, it lets you know how much of a financial asset you own.

For example, you could have a position like this:

A position of **2,000** shares of **MSFT**!

### What is a Portfolio?

A portfolio represents a **collection of all the investments an individual or entity owns.** These financial investments can be any combination of any financial assets such as  **stocks, bonds,cash**, etc.

For example, I could have a portfolio which contains the positions:

**10** shares of **MSFT USD**  and **10** shares of **AAPL USD**

Hypothetically, if a stock of MSFT is worth $50 each and a stock of AAPL is worth $20 each, then the total value of the portfolio above would be $70.
