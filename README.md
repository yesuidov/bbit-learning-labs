[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bloomberg/bbit-learning-labs/HEAD)

Get ready to learn! Bloomberg learning labs are a collection of activities designed to help candidates learn more about particular technologies, financial domain concepts and display how we can use computer science knowledge to solve problems in this domain.

## Rationale

Here at Bloomberg, we wanted to give individual a better insight into what software engineering looks like and how we build our software solutions. This repo contains a series of labs which will walk through & engage developers to create solutions to problems we face at Bloomberg! Through these labs you can learn more about our problem domain and continue to develop your coding skills.

## Framework

This lab follows a framework of learning items. Each learning item should have a goal/objective for the developer to complete. Objective items can build off each other allowing the developer to use their previous code in new problem sets. Each learning item item has set of **engineering provided data** and **developer provided solutions**

### Lab Provided Data

- Problem Background/Jupyter Notebook
- Data Source
- Solution Interface
- Tests

#### *Problem Background/Jupyter Notebook*

The lab will include a Jupyter notebook which gives the developers context & a background into the problem. Additionally, in each of the notebooks there is a section to allow developers to write their solutions. 

#### *Data Source*

Each lab will be setup to provide *generators* for any required data. This is all mock data so feel free to update it as you see fit while working through the lab.

#### *Solution Interface*

For expected solutions, the lab will provide developers with an interface. The methods of this interface are what will be used in tests & are expected of the classes that you create.

#### *Tests*

Every piece of code needs a good test! To help validate that what you've developed matches requirements we've included test files. They focus on the expected use cases of a class, but can always be expanded if you'd like to increase your coverage.
