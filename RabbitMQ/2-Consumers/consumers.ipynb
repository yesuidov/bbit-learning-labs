    "# Rabbit MQ Consumer Learning Item\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a consumer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A consumer is a entity (object, application, etc) that receives information from a queue. In RabbitMQ you can have multiple queues, each with the potential for multiple consumers. In this lab we'll focus on setting up a queue with a single consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Within RabbitMQ messages are directed to queues which work similar to the data structure. Messages are held in a FIFO ordering, where messages enter & leave according to their time. A queue could have multiple consumer and multiple producers, but typically a message will only be given to a single consumer based on the broker's dispatching. This consumer then intakes the message & acknowledges if they can/did handle the request or can rejects the message if they're unable to process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Python using pika a queue can be declared similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "#Build our connection to the RMQ Connection.\n",
    "#The AMPQ_URL is a string which tells pika the package the URL of our AMPQ service in this scenario RabbitMQ.\n",
    "conParams = pika.URLParameters(os.environ['AMQP_URL'])\n",
    "connection = pika.BlockingConnection(parameters=conParams)\n",
    "channel = connection.channel()\n",
    "channel.queue_declare(queue='Test')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue can be bound to an exchange using the queue_bind method\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Afterwards queues can be bound to the exchange using the below method which has various parameters to set the routing key to bind the queue with, the exchange & the name of the queue.\n",
    "channel.queue_bind()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Pika Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the various methods available for consumers & the pika framework refer to https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a class that is setup to be a consumer in the rabbitMQ framework. This class should take messages off a queue & print them to standard out. This class can use a BlockingConnection that blocks in an IOLoop until the program receives an exit signal. The class should take the routing key to be used on construction. This routing key would be used to bind a queue to the exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class should attempt to create an exchange(direct exchange) with the name *RMQ Labs*. This class should create a queue with the name *RMQ Lab Queue* which should be bound to the exchange *RMQ Labs* using the user defined routing key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are bullet points of the criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for a routing key to be passed in during class construction\n",
    "- The class should ensure that an exchange with the name *RMQ Labs* is created or exist. The exchange should be a direct exchange.\n",
    "- The class should ensure that a queue with the name *RMQ Labs Queue* is created or exist. The queue should be bound to the *RMQ Labs* exchange using the routing key provided at construction.\n",
    "- The class should read messages from the queue until a KeyboardInterrupt is given. The information from the read messages (body, header, etc) should be printed to standard out.\n",
    "- *Bonus* The class should have an keyword argument function pointer passed on construction. When a message is read from the queue, if present the body of this message will be passed to the function pointer. The keyword for this should be **messageHandler**\n",
    "- *Bonus* Message consumption should be done in a background thread. The class should expose an additional method that allows users to stop consumption without a KeyboardInterrupt being given. Once called this method will ensure the consumption thread stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Source*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section no data generators are provided\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Solution Interface*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will need to follow the interface provided in the lab. Below is a snippet of the interface for a consumer object that you can inherit from. The methods that will be tested are displayed & will need to be overwritten with your implementation. You're free to add more methods then what is displayed in the interface! \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class consumerInterface():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, routing_key : str, **kwargs) -> None:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def startConsuming(self):        \n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Testing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a system test within docker-compose that starts a python unit test. This unit test should utilize a publisher class (this could be your own or a small mock class) which will publish messages to a particular exchange with a particular routing key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your test should pass a testing method to the consumer as a messageHandler argument which checks if the message read matches what we sent."
